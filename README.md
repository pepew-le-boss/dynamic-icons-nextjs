# Icon Component Optimization

The goal of this repository is to find the best way to create an Icon component that imports SVGs dynamically while maintaining an optimized bundle size.

In the `components` folder, there are multiple variations of Icon components, each attempting a different technique. I've added comments to each of them explaining how they perform.

As of now, a good solution has not been found.

EDIT 28/06/2024: The `Icon5.tsx` is the best solution.
